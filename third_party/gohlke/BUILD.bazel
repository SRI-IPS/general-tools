# Homogeneous Transformation Matrices and Quaternions.
#
# A library for calculating 4x4 matrices for translating, rotating, reflecting,
# scaling, shearing, projecting, orthogonalizing, and superimposing arrays of
# 3D homogeneous coordinates as well as for converting between rotation matrices,
# Euler angles, and quaternions. Also includes an Arcball control object and
# functions to decompose transformation matrices.
