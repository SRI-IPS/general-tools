# Description:
#   The provided source code package contains an efficient and robust method for volumetric
#   occupancy mapping. This method was specifically designed to provide robust results when used in
#   conjunction with noisy measurements, as they result from stereo matching. This method is an
#   extension of OctoMap, which you will require for compiling the provided source code.
#   Details about our method can be found here:
#     http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/occmapping/welcome_e.html#ref
#
#   This has been fully forked from the original code. It is no longer feasible to merge changes
#   from upstream, but that is ok because the original project had been abandoned for years.
