# Description:
#   Ewok: the 3D circular buffer component of TUM's "Real-Time Trajectory Replanning for MAVs using
#   Uniform B-splines and 3D Circular Buffer". Ewok provides a real time volumetric occupancy grid
#   useful for reactive path planning.

licenses(["notice"])  # LGPL code-- header only

# NOTE THAT THERE IS A LINKING BUG HERE--
# As it stands, ewok will only build if and only if some level of optimization is specified.
# otherwise, there is an error at linking stage. I have opened an issue on the maintainer's project
# here: https://github.com/vsu91/ewok/issues/3
# ANYTHING THAT DEPENDS ON THIS LIBRARY WILL NEED TO SPECIFY AT LEAST -O1 AS A COPT
# TODO(murt): revisit this to fix the linking error.
EWOK_COPTS = [
    "-O3",

# NOTE that some modifications were made to these header only files.
